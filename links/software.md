## Utilities
### Communication

#### Jabber Related

* [The Coccinella](http://coccinella.im) - A useful [jabber](http://www.jabber.org) client which offers pretty unique and free whiteboard functionality.
* [Psi](https://psi-im.org) - Another [jabber](http://www.jabber.org) client which is a bit more pretty, stable and light but has no whiteboard functions.

### Capturing
* [Fraps]() - Simple but works like a charm.
* [Gamecam]() - Quite a feature rich capturing program.

### Compression
* [7zip](http://www.7zip.org) - Probably the best compression nowadays with a minimalistic interface. (7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2,TAR)
* [TugZip](http://www.tugzip.com) - All around simple and clean. (Supports 7-ZIP, BH, BZ2, CAB, JAR, LHA (LZH), SQX, TAR, TGZ, YZ1,ZIP)

### CD Writing
* [InfraRecorder](http://infrarecorder.org) - Extremely smooth package, reminds me of the old Nero days (without any extra crap) Also support for x64 platform.
* [IsoRecorder 2](http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com) - Very basic, only burns .iso files, works good but don't expect anything special.
* [WinCdEmu](http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org) - Tool to mount iso images for windows.
